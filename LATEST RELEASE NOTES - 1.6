Fixes on Stage for 1.6.

- Add in the feature on the side menu navigation banner there is now a side opening banner on the site.
- Hyperlinked all 'Contact' features so that if there is a contact us button, image or text there will be a hyperlink to contact.
- Add in the 'Back to top' Icon so when scroll is actioned on page the option 'Back to top' in the bottom right auto appears.
- Changed image at the contact us section, So this is an MG rover badge, Fits and looks alot nicer and more proffestional
- Added a contact us 'bar' with a pop-up. Under contact us section there is a nav bar which you press to open up a feature offering opening hours.
- Removed the bottom 'back to top' images as there is the new feature.
- Removed the click to open Date and time (Javascript) button as there is no need for this.
- Added the social media bar at the bottom with Facebook, Email and instagram and at the top of the page.
- I have added a loading screen so when the page is booted up this will load up the loading screen till the page is ready e.g delay to load whilst Google API calls run its better than a blank or lagged screen
- When someone is using the site, If they need to load anything or the site is running slow this should run the loading screen up.
- Removed writing that is being showed in blank writing only seen when hover, Some side notes was showing, but nothing is able to see now.
- Increased the size of the search bar so it fits nicer on the page and extended the amount of characters allowed in this field.
- Added in the google API calls using google's API so maps and loading runs of a google API. Some slow loading taking around 3 seconds.
- Removed hyperlinks where they are not needed e.g top badges in 1.4 was not working.
- Tidy up on the code and split the CSS into a seperate linked sheet as code was getting to long, now there is HTML,HTML5,Javascript, JS and CSS is seperate.
- (MGB-001) Any background writing is not being showed if highlighted.
